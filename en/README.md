1. Create a new Unity Project and add a "Materials" folder to that project.

2. Go to the Unity Asset Store and [dojo.soy/unityassets](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/search/page=1/sortby=popularity/query=price:0)

3. Search for a 3D object to be your player. We use a SPACESHIP [dojo.soy/spaceship](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/70188) (change to whatever asset we use), but you can use whatever model you want to! Add this 3D object to your "Materials" folder.

4. Find a 3D object to be an obstacle. This can be an enemy vehicle, a rock, or an asteroid! The choice is up to you and the game you want to create! Put 
this object in your games Materials folder.

5. Find a Texture to be your game's background. We used ... (ADD ASSET). This can also be an image from google! (Make sure to put it in your game's "Materials" folder)
