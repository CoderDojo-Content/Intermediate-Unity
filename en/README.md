1. Create a new Unity Project and add a "Materials" folder to that project.

2. Open up the Unity Asset Store (**Window > Asset Store**) and click on "Filters" (on the right of the search bar). Now click "FREE ONLY".

3. Use the search bar to find a 3D object to be your player. We use a *SPACESHIP* [dojo.soy/spaceship](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/70188) *(change to whatever asset we use)*, but you can use whatever model you want to! To Download your new asset click the "Download" button. An import box will pop up, click the "Import" button. Add this 3D object to your "Materials" folder.

4. Find a 3D object to be an obstacle. This can be an enemy vehicle, a rock, or an asteroid! The choice is up to you and the game you want to create! Put 
this object in your games Materials folder.

5. Find a Texture to be your game's background. We used ... (ADD ASSET). This can also be an image from google! (Make sure to put it in your game's "Materials" folder)
