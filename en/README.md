2. Download the [dojo.soy/IntermediateProjectStart](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BybwesgH-2_ZWV9KdHJGNDBnVXM) Unity Project. This has all of the assets you need to make make a game with these Sushi Cards! You wont need to make your own new Unity Project, because this creates a project for you. You will need to open un-zip the file you downloaded and open it within Unity.
