1. Now that you're done with the game you can change it up a little. Here are some ideas

    1. You can try to fix the problem at the end of the **Detecting Collisions** Card. 
    
    Hint: Try using a boolean and checking its value to see if the player should be moving.
    
    2. Implement keyboard controls for the spaceship!
    
    Hint: You used the keys for controls in the first tutorial, take a look at that. 
    
    3. Try getting another asset from the resources listed on the front page. Try and create them like you did with the asteroids.
    
    Hint: Go back to the first tutorial if you don't remember how to make a prefab!
    
    4. Learn more about the programming language you have been using with Unity: C#. Here is a link to Microsoft's Beginner tutorial [dojo.soy/C#Tutorial](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Lvld4EQIC_2706218949).
