1. Create a 3D Object Quad and rename it to "Background"
2. Transform the Background to 0, 0, 0 and set the scale of x and y until it covers the entire Game Display. (Make sure it's set to the "Standalone" Aspect Ratio!)
3. Drag the "done_tile_nebula_green_dff" from the Materials folder in the Project Viewer and put it on the Background in the Hierarchy. Congratulations you have a background!
4. Now lets add something to control! Select the player from the prefabs and put it in the scene at position (0, 0, 0).
